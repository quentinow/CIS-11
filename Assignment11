2. Exchanging Pairs of Array Values
Write a program with a loop and indexed addressing that exchanges every pair of values in
an array with an even number of elements. Therefore, item i will exchange with item i+1,
and item i+2 will exchange with item i+3, and so on.

INCLUDE Irvine32.inc
.data
arr1 DWORD 11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88
.code

main PROC

call Clrscr
mov esi,0; initialize the ESI pointers
mov ecx,(LENGTHOF arr1)/2
L1:
xchg arr1[esi],arr1[esi+1] 
add esi,2

loop L1
exit

main ENDP
END main
