8. Shifting the Elements in an Array
Using a loop and indexed addressing, write code that rotates the members of a 32-bit integer
array forward one position. The value at the end of the array must wrap around to the first position.
For example, the array [10,20,30,40] would be transformed into [40,10,20,30].

INCLUDE Irvine32.inc
.data
arr1 DWORD 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77
arrSize = ($ - arr1) / TYPE arr1
temp DWORD ?
.code

main PROC
call Clrscr
mov esi,(arrSize-1)
mov temp,arr1[arrSize-1]
mov ecx,arrSize
dec ecx

L1:
mov arr1[esi],arr1[esi-1]
dec esi
loop L1
mov arr1[esi],temp

exit
main ENDP

END main
