8. Shifting the Elements in an Array
Using a loop and indexed addressing, write code that rotates the members of a 32-bit integer
array forward one position. The value at the end of the array must wrap around to the first position.
For example, the array [10,20,30,40] would be transformed into [40,10,20,30].
