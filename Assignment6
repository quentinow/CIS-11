 10. Fibonacci Generator
Write a procedure that produces N values in the Fibonacci number series and stores them in an array of
doubleword. Input parameters should be a pointer to an array of doubleword, a counter of the number of
values to generate. Write a test program that calls your procedure, passing N = 47. The first value in
the array will be 1, and the last value will be 2,971,215,073. Use the Visual Studio debugger to open
and inspect the array contents 

 7. Random Screen Locations
Write a program that displays a single character at 100 random screen locations, using a timing delay of
100 milliseconds. Hint: Use the GetMaxXY procedure to determine the current size of the console window.
