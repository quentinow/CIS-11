Homework Questions 1

1.1.3 
1. How do assemblers and linkers work together?

Assembler are a system program that converts assembly language programs into machine language,
while linkers combine the modules into a single program working together to execute the program.

3. What is meant by a one-to-many relationship when comparing a high-level language to machine language?

Hign level language are commonly used today that can be easily understood by programmers,this high-level 
language needs to be converted into machine language. Lines of high-level languages are converted into many 
different instructions for the machine language.

8. Do you suppose type checking on pointer variables is stronger (stricter) in assembly language, 
or in C and C++?
C++ is very strict with type compared to assembly language, because assembly language does use pointer
and only operates using words and bytes.

12. Challenge: Translate the following C++ expression to assembly language, using the example
presented earlier in this chapter as a guide: X 􏰀 (Y * 4) 􏰁 3.

mov eax, Y;
mov ebx, 4;
imul ebx;
add eax, 3;
mov X, eax;

1.2.1 
2. Why do you suppose translated programs often execute more quickly than interpreted ones?
Translated programs excute more quickly then interperted ones because machine language is often hard 
to understand and difficult to write making machine language take to much time.

3.(True/False): When an interpreted program written in language L1 runs, each of its instructions 
is decoded and executed by a program written in language L0.
True

10.Statements at the assembly language level of a virtual machine are translated into state- 
ments at which other level?
Statements at assembly language level are translated into machine level language.

2. What is the decimal representation of each of the following unsigned binary integers?
a. 11111000 = 248
b. 11001010 = 202
c. 11110000 = 240
  
3.What is the sum of each pair of binary integers? 
a. 00001111 +􏰁 00000010 = 00010001
b. 11010101 􏰁+ 01101011 = 101000000
c. 00001111 􏰁+ 00001111 = 00011110

5.What is the minimum number of binary bits needed to represent each of the following unsigned 
decimal integers?
a. 65
b. 409
c. 16385

6.What is the hexadecimal representation of each of the following binary numbers?
a. 0011 0101 1101 1010 
b. 1100 1110 1010 0011 
c. 1111 1110 1101 1011

7.What is the binary representation of the following hexadecimal numbers?
a. A4693FBC 
b. B697C7A1 
c. 2B3D9461
